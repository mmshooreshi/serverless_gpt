# Serverless GPT

Welcome to Serverless GPT, a powerful natural language processing (NLP) tool that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 API to generate AI-powered responses in any language. With its easy-to-use interface, you can quickly and easily set up a chatbot that can converse with your users in their preferred language.

Serverless GPT is powered by Vercel, GitHub, and Telegram, allowing you to quickly deploy a secure, cloud-based chatbot that can be accessed from anywhere. The chatbot is equipped with a moving window, which remembers conversation history and ensures context efficiency. It also has an integrated knowledge graph, which helps the chatbot better understand user queries and generate more accurate responses.

To get started, simply clone the repository from https://github.com/mmshooreshi/serverless_gpt, authenticate with GitHub on Vercel, and then add the repository as a new project. Once the project is set up, update the environment variables, including TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN and OPENAI_API_KEY, and use a VPN to set the webhook. Finally, test out your chatbot by sending messages and commands using Telegram.

So what are you waiting for? Get started today and unleash the power of AI-powered chatbots!
